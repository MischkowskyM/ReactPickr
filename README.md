## ReactPickr - react datetime picker

This is a reimplementation / port of [flatpickr](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr) to react.

The main goals are:
* CSS Compatability
* Same functionality and behavior

## Why not use [react-flatpickr](https://github.com/coderhaoxin/react-flatpickr)?

For most purposes, the react-flatpickr might even be the better option. However, I have ran into some issues with the wrapping approach.

Also, you might rely on two projects updating their packages to get the bugfix you need. 

## Status

This is heavily work in progress. Do not use.
